# Project Title
​
The game I have chosen to do is Tic Cat Toe. A spin on tic tac toe which will feature cat themes instead of the basic tic tac toe. I plan to have a cat theme background and hope to change the X's and O's to custom images of different cats. I will have text that states which player wins ( x || o ) and hope to have a draw state as well. There will be a restart button to restart the board once a player has won. There will be a suprise in the restart button and will have an animation once clicked.

### Problems


1. Was not able to make a draw state ( if no more spaces were available on the board then the text should display DRAW ) 
2. Could not figure out how to make X's and O's custom images
3. Sometimes logic of game messes up and declares a winner before 3 in a row ( you are still able to play it is just incorrect )
